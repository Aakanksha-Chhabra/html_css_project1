# Usage

It can be used as a basic webpage design for any advertisement/blog/article.

# Learning

It is a basic page which uses 
- CSS positioning to move images and container elements on webpage.
- CSS Selectors which point to an html element so that we can style it.
- I have also added new font families with format woff. It uses @font-face to convert from usual font to new font format.
